								<p>We develop a Reinforcement Learning framework for the optimal management of the operation and maintenance of power grids equipped with prognostics and health management capabilities. Reinforcement learning exploits the information about the health state of the grid components. Optimal actions are identified maximizing the expected profit, considering the aleatory uncertainties in the environment. To extend the applicability of the proposed approach to realistic problems with large and continuous state spaces, we use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) tools to replace the tabular representation of the state-action value function. The non-tabular Reinforcement Learning algorithm adopting an ANN ensemble is designed and tested on the scaled-down power grid case study, which includes renewable energy sources, controllable generators, maintenance delays and prognostics and health management devices. The method strengths and weaknesses are identified by comparison to the reference Bellman’s optimally. Results show good approximation capability of Q-learning with ANN, and that the proposed framework outperforms expert-based solutions to grid operation and maintenance management.</p>

								<p>A generalised uncertainty quantification framework for resilience assessment of weather-coupled, repairable power grids is presented. The framework can be used to efficiently quantify both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty affecting grid-related and weather-related factors. The power grid simulator has been specifically designed to model interactions between severe weather conditions and grid dynamic states and behaviours, such as weather-induced failures or delays in components replacements. A resilience index is computed by adopting a novel algorithm which exploits a vectorised emulator of the power-flow solver to reduce the computational efforts. The resilience stochastic modelling framework is embedded into a non-intrusive generalised stochastic framework, which enables the analyst to quantify the effect of parameters imprecision. A modified version of the IEEE 24 nodes reliability test system has been used as representative case study. The surrogate-based model and the Power-Flow-based model are compared, and the results show similar accuracy but enhanced efficiency of the former. Global sensitivity of the resilience index to increasing imprecision in parameters of the probabilistic model has been analysed. The relevance of specific weather/grid uncertain factors is highlighted by global sensitivity analysis and the importance of dealing with imprecision in the information clearly emerges.</p>

								<p>Vulnerability and robustness are major concerns for future power grids. Malicious attacks and extreme weather conditions have the potential to trigger multiple components outages, cascading failures and large blackouts. Robust contingency identification procedures are necessary to improve power grids resilience and identify critical scenarios. This paper proposes a framework for advanced uncertainty quantification and vulnerability assessment of power grids. The framework allows critical failure scenarios to be identified and overcomes the limitations of current approaches by explicitly considering aleatory and epistemic sources of uncertainty modelled using probability boxes. The different effects of stochastic fluctuation of the power demand, imprecision in power grid parameters and uncertainty in the selection of the vulnerability model have been quantified. Spectral graph metrics for vulnerability are computed using different weights and are compared to power-flow-based cascading indices in ranking N-1 line failures and random N-k lines attacks. A rank correlation test is proposed for further comparison of the vulnerability metrics. The IEEE 24 nodes reliability test power network is selected as a representative case study and a detailed discussion of the results and findings is presented.</p>

								<p>Fatigue induced cracks is a dangerous failure mechanism which affects mechanical components subject to alternating load cycles. System health monitoring should be adopted to identify cracks which can jeopardise the structure. Real-time damage detection may fail in the identification of the cracks due to different sources of uncertainty which have been poorly assessed or even fully neglected. In this paper, a novel efficient and robust procedure is used for the detection of cracks locations and lengths in mechanical components. A Bayesian model updating framework is employed, which allows accounting for relevant sources of uncertainty. The idea underpinning the approach is to identify the most probable crack consistent with the experimental measurements. To tackle the computational cost of the Bayesian approach an emulator is adopted for replacing the computationally costly Finite Element model. To improve the overall robustness of the procedure, different numerical likelihoods, measurement noises and imprecision in the value of model parameters are analysed and their effects quantified. The accuracy of the stochastic updating and the efficiency of the numerical procedure are discussed. An experimental aluminium frame and on a numerical model of a typical car suspension arm are used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.</p>

								<p>A generalised probabilistic framework is proposed for reliability assessment and uncertainty quantification under a lack of data. The developed computational tool allows the effect of epistemic uncertainty to be quantified and has been applied to assess the reliability of an electronic circuit and a power transmission network. The strength and weakness of the proposed approach are illustrated by comparison to traditional probabilistic approaches. In the presence of both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, classic probabilistic approaches may lead to misleading conclusions and a false sense of confidence which may not fully represent the quality of the available information. In contrast, generalised probabilistic approaches are versatile and powerful when linked to a computational tool that permits their applicability to realistic engineering problems.</p>

								<p>Security and reliability are major concerns for future power systems with distributed generation. A comprehensive evaluation of the risk associated with these systems must consider contingencies under normal environmental conditions and also extreme ones. Environmental conditions can strongly influence the operation and performance of distributed generation systems, not only due to the growing shares of renewable-energy generators installed but also for the environment-related contingencies that can damage or deeply degrade the components of the power grid. In this context, the main novelty of this paper is the development of probabilistic risk assessment and risk-cost optimization framework for distributed power generation systems, that take the effects of extreme weather conditions into account. A Monte Carlo non-sequential algorithm is used for generating both normal and severe weather. The probabilistic risk assessment is embedded within a risk-based, bi-objective optimization to find the optimal size of generators distributed on the power grid that minimize both risks and cost associated with severe weather. An application is shown on a case study adapted from the IEEE 13 nodes test system. By comparing the results considering normal environmental conditions and the results considering the effects of extreme weather, the relevance of the latter clearly emerges.</p>

								<p> Risk-based power dispatch has been proposed as a viable alternative to Security-Constrained Dispatch to reduce power grid costs and help to better understand of prominent hazards. In contrast to classical approaches, risk-based frameworks assign different weights to different contingencies, quantifying both their likelihood occurrence and severity. This leads to an economically profitable operational schedule by exploiting the trade-off between grid risks and costs. However, relevant sources of uncertainty are often neglected due to issues related to the computational cost of the analysis. In this work, we present an efficient risk assessment frameworks for power grids. The approach is based on the Line-Outage Distribution Factors for the severity assessment of post-contingency scenarios. The proposed emulator is embedded within a generalized uncertainty quantification framework to quantify: (1) The effect of imprecision on the estimation of the risk index; (2) The effect of inherent variability, aleatory uncertainty, in environmental-operational variables. The computational cost and accuracy of the proposed risk model are discussed in comparison to traditional approaches. The applicability of the proposed framework to real size grids is exemplified by several case studies.

						<div class="dropdown-content">
								<p>Cascading failures events are major concerns for future power grids and are generally not treat-able analytically. For realistic analysis of the cascading sequence, dedicated models for the numerical simulation are often required. These are generally computationally costly and involve many parameters and variables. Due to uncertainty associated with the cascading failures and limited or unavailable historical data on large size cascading events, several factors turn out to be poorly estimated or subjectively defined. In order to improve confidence in the model, sensitivity analysis is applied to reveal which among the uncertain factors have the highest influence on a realistic DC overload cascading model. The 95 th percentile of the demand not served, the estimated mean number of line failures and the frequency of line failure are the considered outputs. Those are obtained by evaluating random contingency and load scenarios for the network. The approach allows to reduce the dimensionality of the model input space and to identifying inputs interactions which are affecting the most statistical indicators of the demand not supplied.</p>

						<div class="dropdown-content">
								<p>In this work, we investigate Reinforcement Learning (RL) for managing Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of power grids equipped with Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) capabilities, which allow tracking the health state of the grid components. RL exploits this information to select optimal O&M actions on the grid components giving rise to state-action-reward trajectories maximising the expected profit. A scaled-down case study is solved for a power grid, and strengths and weaknesses of the framework are discussed.</p>

						<div class="dropdown-content">
								<p>This paper presents a framework for stochastic analysis, simulation and optimisation of electric power grids combined with heat district networks. In this framework, distributed energy sources can be integrated within the grids and their performance is modelled. The effect of uncertain weather-operational conditions on the system cost and reliability is considered. A Monte Carlo Optimal Power Flow simulator is employed and statistical indicators of the system cost and reliability are obtained. Reliability and cost expectations are used to compare 4 different investments on heat pumps and electric power generators to be installed on a real-world grid. Generators' sizes and positions are analysed to reveal the sensitivity of the cost and reliability of the grid and an optimal investment problem is tackled by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm.</p>
