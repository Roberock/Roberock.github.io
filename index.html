      <h2 id="profile">Project</h2>

<div align="justify">
I am postdoc at Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) involved in the DAYTIME ITEA3 project, which is  collaborative research between Philips Electronics, TU/e and several other industrial and academic partners. The target of the DAYTIME project is to develop innovative maintenance solutions and digital twin models for complex systems subject to failures. These targets fit within the scope of the industry 4.0 vision. Prior joining the project I worked at the National Institute of Aerospace in collaboration with the Dynamic Systems and Control Branch at NASA Langley. 
Aerospace engineering projects and missions, as well as many other projects in different disciplines, often require innovative decision, systems design, new policies, which must perform safely and reliably under extreme  environmental conditions and changing operational states. Uncertainty inevitably affects the performance of the decisions and is divided in two categories: i) aleatory uncertainty and ii) epistemic uncertainty.
The aleatory uncertainty, also known as irreducible uncertainty, arises due to inherent variability and randomness of an environment where the new decision has to be taken. Aleatory uncertainty can be seen as the state of the environment, a room temperature, the price of a good. These are fluctuating over time in a random way and this inevitably affects the performance of the decision taken. Most importantly, this variability cannot be reduced by collecting more data but only better understood. Then, a new decision, design solution, or policy can be prescribed to be robust against this source of uncertainty.  
In contrast, epistemic uncertainty is in principle reducible. Epistemic uncertainty is generally attributed to a lack of experimental data, limited knowledge, subjective information, vagueness, tolerance imprecision. In principle, it can be reduced by collecting more data, increasing the precision of the measuring instruments, asking more specific question to experts, etc. 
In many cases however, new data can be difficult to obtain due to budget constraints or physical limitations. For instance, consider the design of submarine which seeks to investigate unexplored areas of deep sea beads, an optimal action policy to land a rover on Mars, or a crisis response policy for rare and large size black outs. In these cases, data maybe costly to obtain or impossible to obtain. Emulated data maybe the only data available or only one or two similar events available in the past to define a policy for the future. 
When the available databases are small in size and data is scarce in number and quality, the effect of epistemic uncertainty on our decisions can be quite large. Traditional uncertainty quantification methods  which are based on classic probability theory struggle to cope with large epistemic uncertainties. This is due to a limitation of classical probability theory which ties to describe lack of knowledge via probabilistic statements. In fact, probabilistic assumptions on epistemic uncertain factors the true level of uncertainty affecting the performance of our systems and decisions.
For instance, consider a temperature measurement to check for fever (let say fever occurs if T>38 Celsius) done with a cheap thermometer. Now letâ€™s assume the accuracy of the thermometer is 0.5 C and a measured 37.9 degrees Celsius. In other words, that the true body temperature can have any value in the epistemic interval [37.4, 38.4]. Traditional probability theory would assume a uniform distribution in the interval to characterize this uncertainty and the probability of the person being affected would result a bit less than 0.5, i.e., the probability of T in [38.0, 38.4]. The truth is, however, that the body temperature was not randomly fluctuating at the time of measurement and the person either had fever or not. Investing on a different thermometer can reduce the epistemic interval or performing 1 or 2 measurements on the same person can also reduce the epistemic uncertainty and allows for better informed decision. 
My research project intends to develop mathematical frameworks for decision-making and optimization under mixed sources of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. A formal quantification of the epistemic uncertainty is proposed using different theories (e.g. Scenario theory, Evidence theory, Imprecise probability theory) and used to design better decision. Some of the main goals of this research are as follows: i) to develop new methods for optimizing the reliability of decision, prescribe uncertainty robust digital twins, and resilient decision making policies (both given-data and by hybrid physics-based data-driven methods will be considered); ii) Identify key factors driving the uncertainty in the proposed decision; iii) if the epistemic uncertainty is too large, define an uncertainty reduction strategy to quantify the cost/value from adding a new data point in the data base for each one of the uncertain factors; iv) Consider feedback loop methods to update decisions and account for non-stationarity in the probability generating the uncertain data; v) Consider a mixture of formal and test-based certification methods to prescribe strong probabilistic guarantees on the generalization and reliability of the decision taken or on the selected model and design.

<h2 id="academic-background"> Academic Background, Visiting & Placements</h2>

<div align="justify">
 
I hold a Master and a Bachelor degree in Energy Engineering from the University of Bologna (Italy), a Master of Research in Decision-making Under Risk and Uncertainty 
from the University of Liverpool. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom 2019, while doing research at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty and School of Engineering. My dissertation dealt
with the development of computational frameworks for the analysis of resilience, reliability and vulnerability analysis of power grid systems (<a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3034529/"> Download Dissertation Here  </a>).
During my Ph.D. and Masters I was a visiting student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and at Polytechnic of Milano, Italy, and at Ecole Central de Paris, France, where he spent two five and six months, respectivelly. 
I worked in the start-up group ARAMIS s.r.l.in Milan Italy, where I helped developping Machine Learning (Deep Reinforcement Learning) framework to tackle health menagement and mainteinance problems.

<div align="justify">

My research focuses on developing advanced uncertainty quantification framework for the analysis of complex systems and critical infrastructures. I have experience with optimization under uncertainty and reliability-based design-optimization (RBDO). More recently, I developed anomaly detection methods based on SVM ensembles equipped with formal generalization error bounds. I am also interested in several machine learning methods applicable to anomaly detection, remaining useful life estimation and tasks related to the topic "Prognostics and Health Management". 
During my PhD, my research focused on power networks resilience and reliability.  Specifically, I developed computational tools for the analysis/identification of risks and criticalities based on topological analysis of the network structure and physics-based simulation of the network reaction to critical failures (e.g. cascading events, targeted attacks).
