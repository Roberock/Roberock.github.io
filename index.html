      <h2 id="profile">Project</h2>

<div align="justify">
I am postdoc at Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) involved in the DAYTIME ITEA3 project, which is  collaborative project 
between Philips Electronics TU/e and several industrial and academic partners with the target of developing smart maintenance solutions for industry 4.0 vision.
Prior joining the project I worked at the National Institute of Aerospace in collaboration with the Dynamic Systems and Control Branch 
at NASA Langley. Engineering project and missions often require innovative systems which are designed specifically to operate in extreme environments 
under strongly varying operating conditions. Uncertainty is inevitably affecting the performance of those systems and is typically described as aleatory or epistemic.
The aleatory uncertainty, also known as irreducible uncertainty, is due to inherent variability and randomness of some of the sytem parameters or of the environment where the system is operated. Differently,
epistemic uncertainty is due to a lack of knowledge and is in principle reducible by collecting more data. 
In many cases, experimental data is very difficult to obtain because of budget constratins or physical limitations. Under scarse/limited data sets, epistemic uncertainty can be large and traditional uncertainty quantification methods  based on tradionl probability theory can fail to quantify the true level of uncertainty.
This research project intends to develop mathematical frameworks for determining the effects of uncertainty when limited data is available, e.g., limited failure data and a few anomalies or outliers.
A formal quantifiation of the epistemic uncertainty will be proposed for digitial twins of safety-critical systems. One of the goals is to develop 
a mathematical framework for distributionally robust reliability-based desing-optimization for prescribing optimal decisions (new desings, new policies) and enanch this decision with a 
	formal certificate which quantifies the level of epistemic uncertainty affecting its goodness.

<h2 id="academic-background"> Academic Background, Visiting & Placements</h2>

<div align="justify">
 
I hold a Master and a Bachelor degree in Energy Engineering from the University of Bologna (Italy), a Master of Research in Decision-making Under Risk and Uncertainty 
from the University of Liverpool. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom 2019, while doing research at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty and School of Engineering. My dissertation dealt
with the development of computational frameworks for the analysis of resilience, reliability and vulnerability analysis of power grid systems (<a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3034529/"> Download Dissertation Here  </a>).
During my Ph.D. and Masters I was a visiting student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and at Polytechnic of Milano, Italy, and at Ecole Central de Paris, France, where he spent two five and six months, respectivelly. 
I worked in the start-up group ARAMIS s.r.l.in Milan Italy, where I helped developping Machine Learning (Deep Reinforcement Learning) framework to tackle health menagement and mainteinance problems.

<h2 id="Visiting-Placements">Research Areas & Expertise </h2>

<div align="justify">

My research focuses on developing advanced uncertainty quantification framework for the analysis of complex systems and critical infrastructures. I have experience with optimization under uncertainty and reliability-based design-optimization (RBDO). More recently, I developed anomaly detection methods based on SVM ensembles equipped with formal generalization error bounds. I am also interested in several machine learning methods applicable to anomaly detection, remaining useful life estimation and tasks related to the topic "Prognostics and Health Management". 
During my PhD, my research focused on power networks resilience and reliability.  Specifically, I developed computational tools for the analysis/identification of risks and criticalities based on topological analysis of the network structure and physics-based simulation of the network reaction to critical failures (e.g. cascading events, targeted attacks).
